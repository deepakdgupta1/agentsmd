## Usage Guidelines

**When to Add Research:**
- After completing web searches on a topic
- When discovering valuable domain insights
- Before making architectural decisions based on research

**Document Format:**
Each research document should include:
1. **Topic & Date** - What and when
2. **Research Question** - Why we researched this
3. **Key Findings** - Curated insights (3-7 bullet points)
4. **Sources** - All links with descriptions
5. **Implications for Our Project** - How this informs our decisions
6. **Related Research** - Links to connected topics

**Naming Convention:**
`{topic-slug}-{year}.md`

Examples:
- `ai-code-generation-2026.md`
- `template-ux-patterns-2026.md`
- `agent-frameworks-comparison-2026.md`
