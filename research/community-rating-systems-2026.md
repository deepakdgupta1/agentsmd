# Community Contribution & Rating Systems (2026)

**Research Date:** 2026-02-03
**Category:** Community & Open Source
**Related Topics:** Quality Evaluation, User Experience

## Research Question
What are the best practices for community-driven contribution and rating systems in 2026, applicable to our future community template contributions feature?

## Key Findings

### 1. Community-Built Rubric Systems
Effective rating systems use **open, community-built rubrics** with transparent criteria:
- Evaluation criteria rooted in community values and established standards
- Built with support from diverse stakeholders across the ecosystem
- Designed to evolve and grow over time

### 2. Specific, Measurable Rating Dimensions
Quality rating systems avoid vague language and focus on **specific, measurable criteria**:
- Clear rating dimensions (e.g., contribution significance, originality, relevance)
- Standardized evaluation frameworks
- Specific examples and behaviors encouraged in feedback

### 3. Fair and Standardized Evaluation
Best practices for ensuring fairness:
- **Calibration meetings** - Align raters on standards
- **Automated scoring models** - Reduce subjective bias
- **Rater-bias training** - Educate evaluators on common pitfalls
- **Meaningful engagement** - Thoughtful reviews, not superficial ratings

### 4. Transparent Review Process
Academic and professional review systems emphasize:
- Clear reviewer instructions and guidelines
- Expectations for fair, thoughtful evaluation
- Demonstration of engagement with the contribution
- Constructive feedback, not just numerical scores

### 5. Evolution and Adaptation
Successful systems are designed to:
- Continuously grow and evolve
- Incorporate community feedback
- Adapt criteria based on ecosystem changes
- Remain open and accessible

## Implications for AGENTS.md Generator

### For Future Community Contributions Feature (Post-MVP)

1. **Rating Dimension Design**
   Templates should be rated on specific, measurable criteria:
   - **Clarity** - How well-structured and documented is the template?
   - **Completeness** - Does it cover all essential aspects for the role?
   - **Effectiveness** - How well does it work for the intended use case?
   - **Best Practices** - Does it follow agent configuration best practices?
   - **Customizability** - How easy is it to adapt to specific needs?

2. **Community-Built Standards**
   - Develop rating rubric with input from early users
   - Root criteria in agent development best practices
   - Make evaluation criteria transparent and public
   - Design system to evolve based on community feedback

3. **Quality Assurance Mechanisms**
   - Implement reviewer calibration for curated templates
   - Provide clear guidelines for community contributors
   - Encourage specific, constructive feedback (not just star ratings)
   - Consider automated quality checks (completeness, format validation)

4. **Review Process Design**
   - Fair, thoughtful evaluation process
   - Meaningful engagement required (not drive-by ratings)
   - Constructive feedback encouraged
   - Transparency in why templates are rated certain ways

### MVP Approach (Deferred to Post-MVP)
For MVP, focus on **curated templates** (no community contributions yet):
- We control quality through curation
- Establish best practices and patterns
- Build foundation for future community system
- Gather user feedback to inform rating dimensions

Once we have:
- 20+ curated templates showing patterns
- Active user base providing feedback
- Clear understanding of quality dimensions

Then implement community contributions with robust rating system.
